            You are responsible for the accuracy of information provided when registering, for

        <Section id="billing" title="3. Subscriptions, billing and Stripe">
          <p>
            Paid plans are billed in NZD, monthly or annually. Payments are processed entirely by{" "}
            <strong>Stripe, Inc.</strong> — we never receive or store your full card details.
            Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date; cancelling

        <Section id="liability" title="10. Limitation of liability">
          <p>
            Nothing here limits liability that cannot lawfully be limited, including for death or
            personal injury caused by negligence, or fraud. Subject to that, Samcorp&apos;s total
            aggregate liability arising out of the Service is limited to the fees you paid us in
            the 12 months preceding the claim, and we are not liable for indirect, consequential,
